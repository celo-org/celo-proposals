## Simple Summary
Revert one of the changes added in the [CIP-35](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPS/cip-0035.md) which made the replay protection (see [EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md)) mandatory

## Abstract
This CIP will revert the changes made in CIP-35 and makes it optional flag to configure.

## Motivation
Making the replay protection mandatory breaks our compatibility with Ethereum. EIPs such as [EIP-1820](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1820.md) depend exclusively on not having that limitation. If our biggest concern was to avoid errors or confusion between chains, that should be checked by our tooling or RPC API calls, not an EVM limitation.

## Specification
This change requires activation as part of a hard fork. As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER` clients MUST accept transactions that had not set the `chainId`. This CIP will be included in [Espresso Hardfork - CIP 41](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0041.md)

## Rationale

If we want to be completely compatible with Ethereum, the issue, as explained in the Motivation section should be addressed. The CIP35 changed that without being completely conscient on how that would affect EVM compatibility.

## Backwards Compatibility
This CIP is proposed as part of Espresso Hardfork and therefore will be backwards incompatible. Hardforks in general are backwards incompatible.

## Test Cases
TBD

## Implementation
TBD

## Security Considerations
