### Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

We mention little-endian and big-endian both in the context of bytes and bits. In both contexts we mean for little-endian that it's encoded from the least-significant element to the most-significant one, and similarly for big-endian.

The symbol `||` means array concatenation.

## Simple Summary

This CIP upgrades the epoch SNARK data structure, which is signed by validators during consensus:
1. To be correct when there are less than a specified maximum amount of validators elected.
2. To be slashable with reasonable costs on-chain.

## Abstract

Celo supports the Plumo ultra-light client protocol, where, instead of downloading and verifying many block headers, light clients can download SNARK proofs that update their known validator set to a more recent one. This is facilitated by an "epoch SNARK data" structure which is a SNARK-friendly encoding of validator election results. This structure is signed by validators during consensus and a resulting aggregated BLS signature is stored in blocks following elections.

The currently deployed version of the encoding can be improved on several fronts:
1. It only works correctly when the validator set is at its maximum size. 
2. As it's designed to be SNARK-friendly, the encoding uses the Bowe-Hopwood SNARK-friendly hash function on the entire elected validator set. As a result, showing a double-signing proof for slashing currently requires hashing the entire elected validator set with a non EVM-friendly hash, leading to gas usage that is too high.
3. It's vulnerable to a "future subcommittee" attack, where an attacker that compromises enough validators can pre-sign encodings with future epoch numbers and use them when their compromised subcommittee is elected in the future.

This CIP upgrades the encoding to address all three topics.

## Motivation

- Support validator sets which are not full up to a specified maximum.
- Create the necessary infrastructure for on-chain slashing in the case of double-signing. 

## Specification

We define a few helper functions:
* `encode_integer_X_le` - encodes an unsigned_integer having X bits to bits in a little-endian order.
* `encode_public_key_le` - encodes a BLS12-377 point to a compressed form in bits - the little-endian bits of the x coordinate and a single bit whether y is the greatest of the two possibilities.
* `bits_be_to_bytes_le` - converts big-endian bits to little-endian bytes.
* `bytes_le_to_bits_be` - converts little-endian bytes to big-endian bits.
* `bytes_le_to_bits_le` - converts little-endian bytes to little-endian bits.
* `BHHash` - Bowe-Hopwood hash, as specified in the [Zcash protocol specification](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf), on the Edwards curve defined over the same base field as BLS12-377, as specified in the [Zexe paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/962.pdf).
* `Blake2Xs` - the Blake2s-based variant of Blake2X, defined in the [Blake2X paper](https://blake2.net/blake2x.pdf).
* `pad(array, n, padding_element)` - enlarges the array to size `n`, adding `padding_element` in the new places.
* `truncate(array, n)` - truncates the array to the first `n` elements.

The encoding is currently implemented as:

```
Blake2Xs(
    BHHash(
        encode_integer_16_le(epoch number) || 
        encode_integer_32_le(maximum_non_signers) || 
        validator set
    )
)
```

where `validator_set` is the concatenation of the results of `encode_public_key_le` on each validator public key.

We propose to change it to the following. We first define the parameters `MAX_VALIDATORS = 150` and `SEC_PARAM = 128`. We then specify the new encoding.

```
Blake2Xs(
    encode_integer_16_le(epoch number) || 
    BHHash(
        bytes_le_to_bits_le(truncate(epoch_hash, SEC_PARAM/8)) ||
        bytes_le_to_bits_le(truncate(parent_hash, SEC_PARAM/8)) ||
        encode_integer_32_le(maximum_non_signers) || 
        pad(validator set, MAX_VALIDATORS, G1_GENERATOR)
    )
)
```

where `validator_set` is the concatenation of the results of `encode_public_key_le` on each validator public key, `epoch_hash` is the hash of the current epoch block header, `parent_hash` is the hash of the previous epoch block header (17280 blocks in the past) and

`G1_GENERATOR = (81937999373150964239938255573465948239988671502647976594219695644855304257327692006745978603320413799295628339695, 241266749859715473739788878240585681733927191168601896383759122102112907357779751001206799952863815012735208165030)`


## Rationale

A single Plumo proof can support a fixed amount of validators and epochs. We believe that 150 validators and 130 epochs (~= 130 days) will satisfy Celo's needs for the next 2 years.

Moving the epoch number outside the `BHHash` allows for an efficient on-chain double-signing proof - this proof doesn't need the information inside the `BHHash`, it's just required to show there are two aggregate signatures by a super majority on the same epoch number and distinct opaque outputs of `BHHash`.

Adding the current and parent block header hashes prevents the "future subcommittee" attack since it adds an unpredictable value that the attacker can't predict in advance and therefore can't pre-sign, and establishes a chain of epoch headers. Specifically, the header contains the state hash, which in turn contains the result of the Celo randomness beacon. We take only `SEC_PARAM/8` bytes, since, assuming the bytes are sufficiently unpredictable, an attacker would need to pre-sign around `2^128` different messages in order to succeed.

## Test Cases

* **WIP** - We provide the [plumo-prover](https://github.com/celo-org/plumo-prover) codebase, which consumes data from a Celo deployment and generates Plumo proofs. It will be run on private testnets before the test period and on Alfajores and Baklava during the test period.
* **WIP** - We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of a slashing contract that utilizes [CIP20](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/compare/prestwich/cip-0020) for Blake2Xs and [CIPX]() for BLS12-377 operations.

## Implementation

* **WIP** - The changes are implemented as PRs on [celo-blockchain](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain) ([#1158](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/1158)), [celo-bls-snark-rs](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-bls-snark-rs) ([#183](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-bls-snark-rs/pull/183)) and [celo-bls-go](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-bls-go).

## Deployment Considerations

* This CIP can in fact be deployed as a soft-fork, in the sense that only validators MUST upgrade. Full nodes and light-clients do not verify the correctness of this field. Nevertheless, we suggest to deploy it in a hard-fork to minimize the amount of upgrades validators have to perform.

* The CIP puts a hard upper-bound on the number of validators to be 150.

## Security Considerations

* This is a change to the operations occuring in the COMMIT phase of the consensus protocol. This means that a bug in the implementation can hurt the liveness of the chain. The risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the inputs to encoding methods are self-generated by each validator and so a malicious proposer can't inject arbitrary inputs. Additionally, the signing portions of the code are largely unchanged and have been audited and running in production since Celo launched its mainnet.
