### Terminology

<!-- TODO(victor): Actually go through and add these keywords where appropriate -->
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

## Simple Summary

An extension to the ODIS phone number privacy service to support granular rate limiting with the
goal of hardening passwords for use as encryption and authorization keys.

## Abstract

<!-- TODO(victor): Once we have a roughly agreed upon proposal for the pOPRF, link it here -->
Given the required cryptographic functionality (to be discussed in more detail in a future
proposal), this proposal describes an interface to be exposed by the ODIS service allowing the user
to specify a domain string (i.e. a salt value) with rate-limiting rules to be combined with their
blinded input (e.g.  phone number or password).

Central to the proposed interface are domains. A domain is a struct which specifies rate limiting
information and uniquely identifies the context of the secret to be hashed. As an example, a domain
for hashing an account password might specify an application username of "vitalik.eth" (context) and
a cap of 10 password attempts (rate-limiting parameter). These would be combined with their password
in a one-way function to form the final output.

Queries with distinct domain specifiers will receive uncorrelated output. For example, output from
ODIS with the phone number domain and message `+18002738255` will be distinct from and
unrelated to the output when requesting with a password domain and message `+18002738255`.

Additionally, domain specifiers will control what rate limiting rules are applied. For example the
phone number domain could use the current ODIS rate limiting rules, while the password domain may
use much stricter rules, with parameters that can be tuned by the user or application developer.
Combined with the fact that distinct domains produce uncorrelated output, this allows for the
domains to be used as distinct OPRFs with tunable rate limiting rules.

In order to make this scheme flexible, allowing for user-defined tuning of rate-limits and the
introduction of new rate limiting and authorization rules in the future, domains are defined as
serializeable structs.

## Motivation

Effective [offline password cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking) techniques
limit the use of passwords to derive encryption or authentication keys. Rate-limited hashing can be
used to make it much more difficult to crack a password. Computationally expensive password hashing
functions, such as `PBKDF` and `scrypt`, are commonly used for this purpose, but provide [limited
protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05023) and are expensive to run on end-user devices. ODIS,
the phone number privacy service on Celo, implements a rate-limited hash to protect users' phone
numbers from being extracted from their on-chain identifiers. With some extensions, ODIS can
additionally be used to provide a rate-limited hash for passwords, as well as many more use cases.

[Phone Number Privacy](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/identity/phone-number-privacy)

ODIS' rate-limited hash function is implemented from an
[oblivious](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/4261/F19/hugo-columbia-oprf.pdf) [pseudorandom
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_function_family) (OPRF). In effect, this allows
the service to rate-limit invocations of the logical hash function without every seeing the users'
input (e.g. phone number or password). Unfortunately, it only allows for a single rate limiting
scheme.

In order to support secure password hashing, granular rate limits are invaluable. In order to apply
rate limits on a per-context basis (e.g. restricting the number of guesses on a user's password to a
constant number) ODIS' OPRF scheme must be extended to allow the inclusion of a domain specifier
that is visible to the service.

## Specification

In order to support granular rate-limited hash functionality, ODIS will need to support a new
interface which accepts a domain specifiers, visible to the service, alongside the blinded input.

### Service APIs

[celo-org/celo-monorepo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/tree/master/packages/phone-number-privacy/signer)

#### Existing blinded requests

ODIS currently makes available its OPRF function with the following API:

```typescript
// POST to /getBlindedMessagePartialSig
// Headers:
//   Content-Type: application/json
//   Authorization: ${signature from authorized signer (e.g. DEK) for account}
interface GetBlindedMessageSigRequest {
  // Celo account address. Query is charge against this account's quota.
  account: string
  // Query message. A blinded elliptic curve point encoded in base64.
  blindedQueryPhoneNumber: string
  // Optional on-chain identifier. Unlocks additional quota if the
  // account is verified as an owner of the identifier.
  hashedPhoneNumber?: string
  // [Deprecated] Client-specified request timestamp, in milliseconds.
  // Used for request expiration.
  timestamp?: number
  // Client-specified session ID.
  sessionID?: string
}
```

#### Extension for domain-restricted requests

In order to support domain-restricted queries, a new API is proposed:

```typescript
// POST to /getDomainRestrictedPartialSig
// Headers:
//   Content-Type: application/json
interface GetDomainRestrictedSigRequest {
  // Domain specification.
  // Selects the PRF domain and rate limiting rules.
  domain: Domain
  // Domain-specific options.
  // Used for inputs relevant to the domain, but not part of the domain string.
  // Example: { "authorization": <signature> } for an account-restricted domain.
  domainOptions?: DomainOptions
  // Query message. A blinded elliptic curve point encoded in base64.
  blindedMessage: string
  // Client-specified session ID.
  sessionID?: string
}

interface Domain {
  // Unique name of the domain. (e.g. "ODIS Password Domain")
  name: string
  // Major version number. Allows for backwards incompatible changes.
  version: number
  // Arbitrary key-value pairs.
  // MUST be serializable to EIP-712 encoding.
  [key: string]: EIP712Value
}

interface DomainOptions {
  // Arbitrary key-value pairs.
  // Valid keys and values depend on the domain specification.
  // SHOULD be serializable to EIP-712 encoding.
  [key: string]: EIP712Value
}
```

### Domain specifiers

Domain specifiers serve two functions:

- Define the input domain, such that it is uncorrelated to the output in any other domain.
- Specify the rate limiting function to be used in deciding whether to serve the request.

In order to provide flexibility and support future extensions, the domain specifier is structured
and allows for the usage of multiple domain-specific rate limiting rules, as support by the ODIS
service.

In the domain specifiers, two fields MUST be provided: `name` and `version`. Together, these select
which set of rules the service will apply to the request. Rule sets are included in the ODIS
implementation, and new rulesets may be added over time by software upgrades. Supported `name` and
`version` pairs MUST come from a finite set, and the service MUST return an error if the `name` and
`vesion` in a request are not recognized.

Updating a ruleset in a way that would change the rules applied to existing domains SHOULD be
accompanied by an increase in the `version` number. Domain names SHOULD be human-readable. Version
numbers SHOULD be whole integers.

A domain `name` and `version` MAY be deprecated such that the service will return an error for new
requests. Deprecation of a domain will make all secrets hashed under that domain inaccessible.
Depending on the application, it is likely to be very difficult to full deprecate a domain, as users
will need to actively migrate any usages from the deprecated domain.

With a given `name` and `version`, a number of additional fields MAY be specified to act as
parameters for the rate limiting ruleset (e.g. in a linear backoff ruleset, a field may define the
refresh rate) and to establish the context. In order to ensure deterministic serialization, each
`name` and `version` MUST correspond to a single type definition.

Changing any field in the domain specifier, results in a new domain with completely unrelated
output. (e.g. an attacker cannot simply dial down the security level of a domain. If they tried,
they would get useless output.)

In addition to the domain string, a ruleset MAY allow a number of "domain options". Domain options
are defined by and are relevant to a particular ruleset, but are not part of the domain (i.e. their
value does not effect the function output).

### Examples

The following examples are provided to help understand the scheme. They will likely not be
implemented as described.

**Linear backoff:** A rate limiting scheme allowing up to a given number of requests in a defined
time period could be implemented as a linear backoff with some amount of saved-up quota cap.

```typescript
type LinearBackoffDomain = {
  name: "ODIS Linear Backoff Domain"
  version: 1
  // Length of time, in milliseconds, to refresh a single unit of quota.
  // Undefined refresh time indicates that the quota never refreshes (hard cap).
  refresh?: number
  // Maximum number of saved quota.
  cap: number
  // Unique string to identify the "instance" of this rate limited domain.
  salt?: string
}
```

**Not before:** Useful in the lotteries and other random-selection based protocols, a domain could
be created to restrict requests before a particular time, but publicly available after.

```typescript
type NotBeforeDomain = {
  name: "ODIS Not Before Domain"
  version: 1
  // Unix time after which this domain can be queried.
  notBefore: number
}
```

**Peppered:** Useful in the context of hardening encryption keys for non-public ciphertexts, a
domain could be defined that requires a signature from a pepper-derived key-pair. The pepper may be
stored alongside the ciphertext.

```typescript
type PepperedDomain = {
  name: "ODIS Peppered Domain"
  version: 1
  // Public key of a key-pair derived from the pepper.
  publicKey: string
  // Maximum number of requests that can be made against this domain.
  cap?: number
}

type PepperedDomainOptions = {
  // Nonce value to include in the signature message to make it unique.
  nonce: number
  // EIP-712 signature over the request.
  signature: string
}
```

**Phone number hashing:** The current ODIS rate limiting scheme could be implemented as a particular
domain in the new API. A domain string and options could be written as follows:

```typescript
type PhoneNumberDomain = {
  name: "ODIS Phone Number Domain"
  version: 1
}

type PhoneNumberDomainOptions = {
  // Celo account address. Query is charge against this account's quota.
  account: string
  // Signature from the account, or authorized signer for the account.
  authorization: string
  // Optional on-chain identifier. Unlocks additional quota if the
  // account is verified as an owner of the identifier.
  hashedPhoneNumber?: string
}
```

**Smart contract access controlled:** Useful for expanding the set of use cases to community derived
ones. The address of a smart contract implementing the following interface will be a parameter in
the domain.

```solidity
interface OdisAccessController {
  function shouldAllowOdisRequest(bytes calldata domainData, bytes calldata authorization) external view returns(bool);
}
```

For example, this contract could check that a user owns a certain NFT or has burned a fee before
being allowed access to the signature. The signature would be applied to the domain and the returned
value from the contract function.

```typescript
type SmartContractDomain = {
  name: "ODIS Smart Contract Domain"
  version: 1
  // Address of the contract that controls access to this domain.
  // Call will occur as a view call at the chain head upon receiving
  // the request to determine rate limiting.
  contractAddress: string
  // Specified to ensure an unambiguous smart contract is resolved.
  // An ODIS given service is likely to support only a single chain.
  chainId: number
  // Arbitrary bytes to be included in the smart contract call for
  // use by the contract logic.
  domainData?: string
}

type SmartContractDomainOptions = {
  // Optional parameter to avoid issues if the ODIS service node is behind.
  // When specified, the authorization check should not occur against a block
  // prior to the specified number.
  notBeforeBlock?: number
  // Arbitrary bytes to be included in the smart contract call for use by the
  // contract logic. Intended to be a signature or other authorization string.
  authorization: string
}
```

### Domain serialization

Because any variation in the domain string, by design, results in an unpredictable change in the
output, there must be a canonical (i.e. deterministic) serialization for each given domain string.
Further, there must not be a collision in the encoded domain strings between two semantically
different domain specifiers (i.e. the encoding function must be injective). This matches the
requirements for the encoding function specified in
[EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712#specification). As a result, this proposal adopts
their encoding function for its domains specifiers.

In order to implement EIP-712 hashing, each domain type MUST be expressed as an EIP-712 domain and
type. Domain type definitions MAY be originally written in another format as long as there is a
deterministic and injective mapping to the EIP-712 definition, such as the mapping for a subset of
TypeScript types defined below.

Note that in addition to the domain, the entire request SHOULD be serializeable as an EIP-712
object. This allows hashing and signing of the full requests. In particular, this means that an
EIP-712 type definition SHOULD be provided for the domain options.

#### Mapping TypeScript to EIP-712 types

In order to serialize a given `Domain` type, we must first define it as a EIP-712 object. As shown
above, domains may be represented as TypeScript types, in which case they need to be mapped to an
equivalent EIP-712 object. In this section is an example mapping from TypeScript types to EIP-712.

To form the EIP-712 domain, the required `name` and `version` fields of the `Domain` type are used
to populate the respective fields in an `EIP712Domain`. Additional fields of the `Domain` struct are
used to construct an EIP-712 type.

Other fields in the domain form the EIP-712 type. The EIP-712 type name SHOULD be equal to the
interface name. Fields within the interface are sorted by name. Values SHOULD be mapped from their
TypeScript types to the corresponding EIP-712 type. Specifically:

* `string`  -> `string`
* `number`  -> `int256`
* `boolean` -> `bool`

Optional values are encoded by interpreting it as EIP-712 type `Optional<T>(bool defined,T value)`,
with `T` as the generic type name. When serialized, `value` MUST be set to the zero value of the
type when `defined` is `false`. The zero value of a type is the value when all atomic types are set
to zero, and dynamic types (`string` and `bytes`) are empty. Note that the zero hash of the encoded
data of two distinct types may be distinct (i.e. it is not equal to the empty hash).

As an example, the following instance of a `LinearBackoffDomain` is hashed:
```typescript
const domain: LinearBackoffDomain = {
  name: "ODIS Linear Backoff Domain"
  version: 1
  cap: 10
  salt: "saltvalue"
}
```

<!-- TODO(victor) Verify that there are no mistakes in this example. -->
```text
domainSeparator = keccak256(
  keccak256("EIP712Domain(string name,string version)") ||
  keccak256("ODIS Linear Backoff Domain") || keccak256("1")
)
typeHash = keccak256(
  "LinearBackoffDomain(int256 cap, Optional<int256> refresh, Optional<string> salt)" ||
  "Optional<int256>(bool defined,int256 value)" ||
  "Optional<string>(bool defined,string value)"
)

    keccak256("saltvalue")
  )
)
encoded = 0x1901 || domainSeparator || structHash
```

### Signatures

Signatures are a useful primitive for authenticated rate limiting (e.g. allowing a higher rate limit
to the owners of verified accounts on Celo). In order to facilitate this, the entire request struct
SHOULD be deterministically serializeable, specifically using EIP-712.

Domains that make use of signatures for authentication of requests (e.g. the `PepperedDomain`
example below) SHOULD include a field in the domain options for specification of a signature.
Additional fields MAY also be added, such as a nonce to prevent replaying requests.

Signatures SHOULD be verified over the entire request, excluding the signature itself. Specifically,
the message against which a signature is verified SHOULD be obtained by first setting the signature
field value to its zero value (e.g. empty string) object, then serializing the
`GetDomainRestrictedSigRequest` object via EIP-712.

Serializing the request SHOULD use the EIP-712 domain `{ name: "ODIS Domain Restricted Signature
Request", version: "1" }` and type defined by applying the type mapping [defined
above](#mapping-typescript-to-eip-712-types) to the `GetDomainRestrictedSigRequest` type.

### HTTP Transport

When requested over HTTP, which is the primary proposed transport, the following HTTP semantics
SHOULD be followed.

If a given `name` and `version` are not recognized by an ODIS signer, it SHOULD return a `501: Not
Implemented` error. If a given `name` and `version` are recognized, but are deprecated, it SHOULD
return a `405: Method Not Allowed` error. Signers SHOULD keep a list of all old domain names and
version, even if they are no longer supported.

When a user's request is rejected for violating the rate limiting of a domain, the service SHOULD
respond with `429: Too Many Requests`. If the waiting would allow for additional requests against
the same domain, the service SHOULD include the `Retry-After` header to specify how long the client
must wait. ODIS servers MAY apply additional rate limiting, such as by IP address. Any rate limiting
rules outside of those applied per domain MUST be counted against first, such that a request
dropped by optional rate limiting rules will not be counted against the domain quota.

### Key management

<!-- TODO(victor) Replace this Notion link when the proposal is written up as a CIP -->
Because ODIS' current OPRF function operates with the same cryptographic primitives as the [proposed
function](https://www.notion.so/pOPRF-Cryptography-Proposal-493f1099460940f8a5d7dee4c78b4442), and
because its a bad idea in general to reuse keys, implementation of this proposal MUST use a new set
of keys, not used in any other service.

Keys used in this service SHOULD be generated through a DKG ceremony amongst the servers that will
operate the service. This new public key SHOULD be distributed along with client implementations and
used to verify the values returned from the new API. Note that the existing ODIS OPRF key will
continue to be used to verify output from the existing API.

### Cryptographic interface

Implementation of a domain-restricted hashing function is built on top of a partial
[oblivious](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~tal/4261/F19/hugo-columbia-oprf.pdf) [pseudorandom
function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_function_family) (pOPRF). It extends the
existing OPRF, currently implemented by ODIS, by adding a second input, which is not blinded, and
can be used by the pOPRF for rate limiting.

With respect the client, this functionality has the interface $F_K(d,m)$ where $d$, $m$, and the
output are binary strings. $K$ is a public key which commits to the output of the function, and
allows for verification. $d$ is considered the "domain string" and is visible to the pOPRF service.
$m$ is the message string, and is hidden from the pOPRF service. Both strings are combined
cryptographically in a one-way function to form the output.

Multiple candidate implementations exist for this functionality. Linked below is the proposed
cryptographic design for use in the ODIS pOPRF service. Other implementation with the same interface
may also be used to implement the following service design.

Note that in the proposed interface, and in the function proposal below, only a single public key,
and corresponding shareded service key, is used to produce and verify outputs from the pOPRF
regardless of the domain. As a result only a single key needs to be generated via DKG for this
functionality, and the client only needs to obtain a single public key. (Other functionalities,
namely the current ODIS OPRF, will need seperate keys)

[pOPRF Cryptography Proposal](https://www.notion.so/pOPRF-Cryptography-Proposal-493f1099460940f8a5d7dee4c78b4442)

## Backwards Compatibility

Backwards compatibility for current users of ODIS is ensured because this proposal leaves in place
all existing functionality, including the public keys currently used to operate the service.

## Security Considerations

Incorrect implementation or operation of the ODIS service can have very serious effects on users of
the service. In particular, a bug in the rate limiting code or compromise of a threshold of nodes
could allow an attacker to bypass rate limiting and derive a user's secret from its hash or other
commitment.

Implementing this proposal involves writing new code to be included in the ODIS service, which
implies a potential increase in the attack surface and opportunities to introduce security
vulnerabilities. Care should be taken to ensure the correctness of the implementation, including
testing, careful code review, and potentially third-party audits.
