This is the Meta CIP for the technical specifications of the Celo Gingerbread Hardfork.

## Simple Summary

Enable the activation of the Celo Gingerbread Hardfork specification which focuses on Ethereum alignment.

## Abstract

Add support for protocol-impacting changes that increase alignment with Ethereum by removing unused Celo-specific features and protocol differences. This hardfork is named _Gingerbread_ by the community.

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Celo networks:
- `TODO` on Baklava Testnet
- `TODO` on Alfajores Testnet
- `TODO` on Celo Mainnet

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIP and CIP implementations, please see the _Specification_ section of this document.

## Motivation

To enhance the EVM's capabilities and while pushing forward the Celo blockchain functionality in order to enable economic conditions for prosperity as well as reducing differences with Ethereum which will lead to increased compatibility and ease maintenance.

## Specification

The Gingerbread Hardfork specification meta document includes the following proposals.

CIPs to be included:
- [CIP-52: Ultragreen Celo](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0052.md)
- [CIP-53: Remove minimum client version check](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0053.md)
- [CIP-54: Remove sending of community rewards to reserve if undercollaterized](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0054.md)
- [CIP-55: Remove Tobin Tax](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0055.md)
- [CIP-56: Remove freezable check on epoch rewards](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0056.md)
- [CIP-57: Remove full node incentives](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0057.md)
- [CIP-58: Restore opcode gas costs from Ethereum](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0058.md)
- [CIP-59: Re-add header fields with values used in Ethereum 2.0](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0059.md)
- [CIP-60: Add GASLIMIT opcode](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0060.md)
- [CIP-61: Add BASEFEE opcode](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0061.md)


With the above CIPs the block header contains the same data as the Ethereum chain. Therefore, the hash of the header will be changed so that it is compatible with Ethereum.

## Rationale

__Ethereum Compatibility__: We include CIPs to increase compatibility with ethereum transactions and opcodes.

__Celo Network Maintenance__: Several CIPs are included to simplify maintenance of the Celo blockchain code by removing unused features.


## Implementation

Adoption of the content of this CIP requires a hardfork as it introduces changes that are not backward compatible. The following clients with Celo support will implement the Celo Gingerbread hardfork specification:
- celo-blockchain
