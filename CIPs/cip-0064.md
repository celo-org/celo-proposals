## Simple Summary

Create a new [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) Transaction Type that will act as [eip1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) transaction but including the `feeCurrency` field for paying in a different currency.

## Abstract

This CIP proposes to create a new EIP-2718 Transaction Type `0x7b`, which will have the same functionality as the [CIP-42](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0042.md), but removing the `gatewayFee` and the `gatewayFeeRecipient` fields (already deprecated in the [CIP-57](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0057.md)).
This new transaction is encoded as follows: `0x7b || rlp([chainId, nonce, maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, feeCurrency, signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS])`

## Motivation

In the Espresso Hard Fork [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) was introduced. We also added a new transaction type `0x7c`, which is the `CeloDynamicFee` transaction from [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), with the ability to be paid in a different currency. This transaction type was added as part of [CIP-42](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0042.md).

In our pursuit to be closer to Ethereum and become an L2, we are deprecating the full node incentives ([CIP-57](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0057.md)), which will make the CIP-42 a transaction that will maintain two unused fields (the `gatewayFee` and `gatewayFeeRecipient`). This CIP aims to give a pruned alternative that eventually will allow us to deprecate CIP-42 transactions without loosing any functionality and allow a smoother transition to L2.

## Specification

### Definitions

- `TransactionType` `123` ⇒ `0x7b`. See [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
- `||` is the byte/byte-array concatenation operator
- `feeCurrency` is the address of the whitelisted currency to be used to pay for gas

As of `FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER`, a new [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) transaction is introduced with `TransactionType` `123`.

The [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) `TransactionPayload` for this transaction is `0x7b || rlp([chainId, nonce, maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, feeCurrency, signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS])`.

The `signatureYParity, signatureR, signatureS` elements of this transaction represent a secp256k1 signature over `keccak256(0x7b || rlp([chainId, nonce, maxPriorityFeePerGas, maxFeePerGas, gasLimit, to, value, data, accessList, feeCurrency]))`.

The [EIP-2718](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) `ReceiptPayload` for this transaction is `rlp([status, cumulativeGasUsed, logsBloom, logs])`.

## Rationale

The creation of this new transaction type will maintain functionality that we already have and will also allow us to prune our codebase in the L2 migration. That future migration will require to reduce differences to Ethereum as much as we can to reduce the complexity added for proof creations in either scenario (optimistic and zk), for example the future removal of the transaction added in the CIP-42 plus reverting the celo legacy tx, to be exactly the same as the legacy in Ethereum. Also, it will give us the opportunity to prune our codebase and make it more maintainable.

## Backwards Compatibility

As every new transaction type, this needs to be added as part of a fork, and as it is a new transaction type, it shouldn’t change any actual behaviour.

## Implementation

An implementation suggestion is available at [https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/2170](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/2170)

## Security Considerations

This contains the same considerations as the CIP-42.
