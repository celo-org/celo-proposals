This is the Meta CIP for the technical specifications of the Celo E Hardfork.

## Simple Summary

Enable the activation of the Celo E Hardfork specification which includes Ethereum Berlin EIPs, Ethereum London EIPS, and Celo CIPs.

## Abstract

Add support for protocol-impacting changes introduced in the Ethereum Berlin and London hardforks and Celo improvement proposals in a hardfork
named by the community as _"E"_.

This hardfork contains all applicable EIPs in Berlin and London. Some EIPs have been modified to work with the Celo network.

This document proposes the following blocks at which to implement these changes in the Celo networks:
- `TBD` on Baklava Testnet
- `TBD` on Alfajores Testnet
- `TBD` on Celo Mainnet

For more information on the opcodes and their respective EIPs and CIP implementations, please see the _Specification_
section of this document.

## Motivation

The enhance the EVM's capabilities and while pushing forward the Celo blockchain functionality in order to enable economic conditions for prosperity as well as adopting Ethereum's Berlin and London specifications.

## Specification

The "E" Hardfork specification meta document includes the following proposals:

From Berlin
* [EIP-2565: ModExp Gas Cost](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565)
* [EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929)
* [EIP-2718: Typed Transaction Envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718)
* [EIP-2930: Optional access lists](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930)

From London
* [EIP-1559: Fee market change for ETH 1.0 chain](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)
* [EIP-3198: BASEFEE opcode](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198)
* [EIP-3529: Reduction in refunds](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3529)
* [EIP-3541: Reject new contracts starting with the 0xEF byte](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3541)

Modifications to the EIPs
* [EIP-3554: Difficulty Bomb Delay](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3554) (Included in London) will not be included in the "E" Hardfork
* [CIP-42](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0042.md): Modifies EIP-1559 as it is already partially implemented on Celo but the upstream implementation does not match what is on Celo.
* EIP-2929 may have different gas costs
* The `BASEFEE` opcode should return the result of calling `getGasPriceMinimum` to the `GasPriceMinimum` smart contract at the end of the previous block.

CIPs to be Included
* CIP-???: Block Context
* CIP-???: Increased round change timer for early rounds in IBFT
* CIP-???: Relax canPayFee condition for non-native tokens


## Rationale

__Ethereum Compatibility__: We include EIPs to maintain compatibility with ethereum transactions and opcodes.

__Celo Network Performance__: Several CIPs are included to improve the performance of the network.


## Implementation

Adoption of the content of this CIP requires a hardfork as it introduces changes that aren't backward compatible. The following clients with Celo support will implement the Celo "E" hardfork specification:
- celo-blockchain
