## Simple Summary

Remove all precompiles related to the BLS-12377 curve ([CIP-30](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0030.md)), the BLS-12381 ([CIP-31](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0031.md)) curve, the [CIP-20](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0020.md) and [CIP-25](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0025.md).

## Abstract

This CIP proposes to remove all precompiles related to the BLS-12377 curve, the BLS-12381 curve, the CIP-20 and CIP-25.

## Motivation

In the context of moving Celo closer to Ethereum and reducing technical debt these precompile removals offer the opportunity to remove unused code.

The additions to Celo were proposed in the following CIPs:

- [CIP-30](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0030.md), which follows [EIP-2539](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2539.md)
- [CIP-31](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0031.md), which follows [EIP-2537](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2537.md)
- [CIP-20](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0020.md)
- [CIP-25](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/cip-0025.md)

Both EIP-2539 and EIP-2537 were never accepted into Ethereum and are therefore a good target for deprecation before the move to an L2. CIP-20 and CIP-25, also unused precompiles, are added as part of this deprecation CIP to be closer to Ethereum.

## Specification

The following precompiles will be removed and no longer be accessible after the Gingerbread hardfork.

## Rationale

In the pursuit of reducing the differences between Celo and Ethereum, which will help us in the transition to being an L2, and as none of these precompiles has ever been invoked (used) by any transaction in all of our networks (at the time of writing this CIP), removing these precompiles is not only safe but is also going to bring our code base closer to Ethereum.

## Backwards Compatibility

Changes to precompiles impact the execution environment and require a hard fork.

## Test Cases

The precompiles must not be accessible at the addresses noted under "Specification" after the hardfork has been activated.

## Implementation

Implementations suggestion are available at [https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/2168](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/2168) and [https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/2177](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/pull/2177)
