## Simple Summary

Move the `minimumGasPrice` of Celo from our core contract to the header of the block, and activate the [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198) (add the `baseFee` opcode)

## Abstract

This CIP proposes to remove the `minimumGasPrice` update made by our consensus layer at the end of each block, to be calculated at the beginning of every block proposed, and storing it in the header. Also, the implementation of the [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198) which adds the `baseFee` opcode to the EVM.

## Motivation

This CIP aims to reduce the complexity of our consensus layer, and get us closer to the Ethereum’s implementation of the [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559). This will facilitate future upstream merges and the plans to separate our execution and consensus layers.

## Specification

### Definitions

- `blockGasLimit` is a governable parameter from the [BlockchainParametersContract](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/BlockchainParameters.sol#L30) that represents the gas limit of the block
- `blockGasTotal` is the gas used for an specific block
- `blockDensity` is a number in the interval `[0, 1]` that represents the usage rate of the block ⇒  `blockGasTotal / blockGasLimit`
- `adjustmentSpeed` is a governable parameter from the [GasPriceMinimumContract](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GasPriceMinimum.sol#L38) that represents the speed of gas price minimum adjustment due to congestion
- `targetDensity` is a governable parameter from the [GasPriceMinimumContract](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GasPriceMinimum.sol#L35) that represents the block congestion level targeted by the gas price minimum calculation
- `gasPriceMinimumFloor` is a governable parameter from the [GasPriceMinimumContract](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GasPriceMinimum.sol#L32) that represents the minimum gas price threshold

### Blockchain node

Add the `baseFee` field to the header structure.

Implement the [EIP-3198](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3198) that adds the `BASEFEE (0x48)` opcode.

Switch the way we are storing the `gasPriceMinimum` (requires to be enabled during a hardfork)

Currently the `GasPriceMinimum` is modified and saved calling the `GasPriceMinimum` contract in the finalize stage of the consensus [here](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/master/consensus/istanbul/backend/engine.go#L512). This must be avoided from the Hardfork Block.

Then, in the `prepareBlock` function ([here](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-blockchain/blob/master/miner/block.go#L58)) will need to

- For the G_HARDFORK_BLOCK:
  
  Retrieve the `gasPriceMinimum` of the actual state (which was updated at the end of the `G_HARDFORK_BLOCK - 1`) and add that number as the `baseFee` of the header
  
- From the `G_HARDFORK_BLOCK + 1`:
  
  `newCalculatedBaseFee = parent.baseFee * (1 + (adjustmentSpeed * (parent.blockDensity - targetDensity))) + 1`
  
  `baseFee = newCalculatedBaseFee >= gasPriceMinimumFloor ? newCalculatedBaseFee : gasPriceMinimumFloor`
  
  Alternatively the client should call the `getUpdatedGasPriceMinimum` of the modified `gasPriceMinimum` contract with the state of the parent block, to retrieve the new `baseFee`
  
### Contracts

Before the hardfork, we will need to deploy a new version of the `GasPriceMinimum` contract with the following changes:

- Rename the `gasPriceMinimum` variable to `deprecated_gasPriceMinimum`
  
    This step is required to be able to define a new function `gasPriceMinimum` that will return the renamed variable `deprecated_gasPriceMinimum` or the `block.basefee` depending on the `G_HARDFORK_BLOCK`
  
- Change the way the `gasPriceMinimum` getter was defined and override it:
  
    ```solidity
    gasPriceMinimum() view returns (uint256) {
        if (G_HARDFORK_BLOCK > 0 && block.number >= G_HARDFORK_BLOCK) {
          return block.baseFee;
        } else {
          return gasPriceMinimum;
        }
    }
    ```
  
- Change the implementation of `getGasPriceMinimum` ([line 116](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/common/GasPriceMinimum.sol#L116)) to:
  
    ```solidity
    function getGasPriceMinimum(address tokenAddress) external view returns (uint256) {
        if (
          tokenAddress == address(0) ||
          tokenAddress == registry.getAddressForOrDie(GOLD_TOKEN_REGISTRY_ID)
        ) {
          return gasPriceMinimum();
        } else {
          ISortedOracles sortedOracles = ISortedOracles(
            registry.getAddressForOrDie(SORTED_ORACLES_REGISTRY_ID)
          );
          uint256 rateNumerator;
          uint256 rateDenominator;
          (rateNumerator, rateDenominator) = sortedOracles.medianRate(tokenAddress);
          return (gasPriceMinimum().mul(rateNumerator).div(rateDenominator));
        }
    }
    ```
  
- Update the `getUpdatedGasPriceMinimum` function to maintain compatibility
  
    ```solidity
    function getUpdatedGasPriceMinimum(uint256 blockGasTotal, uint256 blockGasLimit)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256)
      {
        FixidityLib.Fraction memory blockDensity = FixidityLib.newFixedFraction(
          blockGasTotal,
          blockGasLimit
        );
        bool densityGreaterThanTarget = blockDensity.gt(targetDensity);
        FixidityLib.Fraction memory densityDelta = densityGreaterThanTarget
          ? blockDensity.subtract(targetDensity)
          : targetDensity.subtract(blockDensity);
        FixidityLib.Fraction memory adjustment = densityGreaterThanTarget
          ? FixidityLib.fixed1().add(adjustmentSpeed.multiply(densityDelta))
          : FixidityLib.fixed1().subtract(adjustmentSpeed.multiply(densityDelta));
    
        uint256 newGasPriceMinimum = adjustment
          .multiply(FixidityLib.newFixed(gasPriceMinimum())) // This line
          .add(FixidityLib.fixed1())
          .fromFixed();
    
        return newGasPriceMinimum >= gasPriceMinimumFloor ? newGasPriceMinimum : gasPriceMinimumFloor;
      }
    ```
  
- The `updateGasPriceMinimum` is only called by the VM, and must not call this function after the HardFork. There is not need to change it other than having a cleaner contract.

## Rationale

The decision of moving the `gasPriceMinimum` to the header as the `baseFee` give us a few benefits:

- It will bring us closer to upstream, what will increase our compatibility with Ethereum, not only from our node perspective (it will simplify our client), but also for the tools of the ecosystem
- It will simplify our consensus layer. Avoiding the update of the `gasPriceMinimum` variable in our core contract, it won’t modify the final state of the block, thus it won’t generate a block receipt, which is something we want to reduce as much as possible
- The contract’s developers, will be able to use an opcode instead of a contract call to know the `gasPriceMinimum` of the block

## Backwards Compatibility

This needs to be added as part of a fork. To maintain full backwards compatibility, we will also need to re deploy the `GasPriceMinimum` contract consuming the `baseFee` opcode.

### Block Hash Changing

The datastructure that is passed into keccak256 to calculate the block hash is changing, and all applications that are validating blocks are valid or using the block hash to verify block contents will need to be adapted to support the new datastructure (one additional item). If you only take the block header bytes and hash them you should still correctly get a hash, but if you construct a block header from its constituent elements you will need to add in the new one at the end.

## Test Cases

### Nominal case

Assuming current block base fee is `7 wei`. This should push the value `7` (left padded byte32) to the stack.

Bytecode: `0x4800` (`BASEFEE, STOP`)

Pc | Op | Cost | Stack | RStack
-- | -- | -- | -- | --
0 | BASEFEE | 2 | [] | []
1 | STOP | 0 | [7] | []

Output: `0x` Consumed gas: `2`

## Security Considerations

Just as a consideration, even if it won’t be a big change, this CIP adds a field to the header which will increases its size.
