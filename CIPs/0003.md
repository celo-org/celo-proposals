# CIP [0003]: Identity Claims and Metadata

- Date: 2019-09-19
- Author: @timmoreton
- Status: Implemented

## Overview

This CIP describes a general mechanism that allows principals on the Celo platform to claim real-world identities and maintain rich, unverified metadata. Third parties can verify these identity claims, and use the associated unverified metadata as appropriate.

There are a number of principals that provide resources to or deploy services on the Celo platform that may wish to assert identities or provide metadata. These include, but are not limited to:
* Validators
* Validator groups
* Smart contract owners
* DApp developers
* Creators of Governance proposals
* Oracles

Use cases include:
* Tools want to present public metadata supplied by a validator or validator group as part of a list of candidate groups, or a list of current elected validators.
* Governance Explorer UIs may want to present public metadata about the creators of governance proposals
* A DApp makes a request to the Celo Wallet for account information or to sign a transaction. The Celo Wallet should provide information about the DApp to allow the user to make a decision whether to accept the transaction or not.

## Goals

- Allow principals to make an extensible range of identity claims, and support clients verifying the veracity of these
- Allow principals to supply unverified extensible, structured metadata off-chain
- Allow tools to choose what metadata they require and how they present it
- Support both public (unencrypted) metadata and metadata accessible only to the Celo Foundation

## Proposed/Implemented Solution

The metadata MVP data format for now would looks as following. It's basically a chain of statements, where each statement has the following base format (inspired by keybase):

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "address": "0x0",
    "signature": "0x0"
  },
  "claims": [
    {
      "type": "CLAIM_TYPE",
      "timestamp": 1588886114907
    }
  ]
}
```

This metadata file can be hosted anywhere accessible via HTTP. The URL to this file can be registered on the `Accounts` smart contract's `setMetadataURL` function.

### Validation Rules

- `meta.address` should equal to the address of the account on the Celo mainnet
- `meta.signature` should be a valid signature of the account or any authorized signers of the account over the hash of hashes of each claim concatenated.
- `claim.timestamp` should be the time in UNIX seconds

### Valid Claim Types

**Keybase Claim**:
```json
{
  "type": "KEYBASE",
  "timestamp": 1588886114907,
  "username": "keybase_username"
}
```

Keybase claims can be verified by checking for the signed claim under the path `.well-known/celo/verify-${accountAddress}` in the public Keybase Filesystem folder.

**DNS Claim**:
```json
{
  "type": "DOMAIN",
  "timestamp": 1588886114907,
  "username": "example.com"
}
```

Domain claims can be verified by checking for TXT record on the domain for a signature of any authorized signer of the acccount over the serialized claim prefixed with `celo-site-verification=`

**Account Claim**:
```json
{
  "type": "ACCOUNT",
  "timestamp": 1588886114907,
  "address": "0x1",
  "publicKey": "0x2"
}
```

Account claims can be verified by checking for an equivalent counter-claim in the claimed account's metadata.

**Attestation service URL claim**:
```json
{
  "type": "ATTESTATION_SERVICE_URL",
  "timestamp": 1588886114907,
  "url": "https://example.com/attestation-service",
}
```

Attestation service URL claims cannot be verified. They serve as per CIP1 to determine where validators acting as attestation issuers are available to receive attestation requests (after going through the request on the `Attestations` smart contract).
