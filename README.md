# CIPs

Celoâ€™s Improvement Proposals (CIPs) describe standards for the Celo platform, including the core protocol specifications, SDK, and contract standards. A CIP is a design document that should provide background information, a rationale for the proposal, detailed solution including technical specifications, and, if any, a list of potential risks. The proposer is responsible for soliciting community feedback and for driving consensus.

For the new CGP (Celo Governance Proposal) repository, please go to the [Governance Repo](https://github.com/celo-org/governance)

There may be instances that require both CIP and CGP, such as a change to a smart contract that requires a governance proposal to point the proxy to the new instance.

Participation in the Celo project is subject to the [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).
