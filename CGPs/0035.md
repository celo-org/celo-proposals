## Overview

This change decreases the communityRewardFraction from 25% to 5% by setting `communityRewardFraction` to 50000000000000000000000. 

At this point the marginal value of additional CELO being issued to the governance contract seems incredibly low. There are currently 6.5 million CELO in the governance contract which hold the community funds ('0xD533Ca259b330c7A88f74E000a3FaEa2d63B7972').
As a community we have yet to figure out an efficient way to deploy this capital, and until we do, reducing the community fund share of epoch rewards would help to reduce the spending ahead of schedule, which has a downscaling effect on all epoch reward allocations: Voter rewards, validator rewards, communtiy fund rewards, and carbon offsetting.
This proposal comes with the understanding that the community fund share should be raised again if the CELO in the community fund starts being put to productive use at a faster rate.


Parameter Details:

- communityRewardFraction: 250000000000000000000000 (0.25 * 10^24) --> 50000000000000000000000 (0.05 * 10^24)


## Proposed Changes

1. Set EpochRewards communityRewardFraction
  - Destination: EpochRewards, [setCommunityRewardFraction](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L176)
  - Data: 
    - _communityRewardFraction = 50000000000000000000000
  - Value: 0 (NA)


## Verification

Check that`communityRewardFraction` through [getCommunityRewardFraction] is actually changed to 50000000000000000000000

## Risks
- Once the CELO in the community fund are being put to good use at a faster rate, it will likely be useful to increase the community fund epoch reward share again to support that growth. This will be a governance decision and dependent on how network participants will vote.
