# CGP [0004]: Rename Celo Gold to Celo Native Asset

- Date: 2020-06-03
- Author(s): @JamesCowling
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: 4
- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

This proposal decrees that the name "Celo Gold" be discontinued and that the
Celo native asset be officially referred to as simply the "Celo native asset".
The shortened name Celo (CELO) will be used as ticker symbol and in casual
parlance.

The name Celo Gold is confusing since it doesn't relate to the price of gold.
There will likely be multiple Celo stablecoins with names like Celo Dollar, Celo
Euro and Celo Peso one day and potentially even a Celo Gold stablecoin.

Even despite the potential naming collision, the gold metaphor doesn't
adequately represent the properties of the native Celo asset, which include
staking and voting on governance.

The name "Celo" casts a clear distinction between the native asset and the
suite of stablecoins that will develop over time.

It is important to establish appropriate naming now while it's early in the
life of the ecosystem.

## Proposed Changes

This proposal does not dictate specific transactions or code changes since these
will have to roll out over time. It instead establishes the new naming
in principal and can be subsequently acted upon by Celo contributors. These
changes will span the Celo documentation and marketing, as well as the Celo
codebase where appropriate.

Note that it will likely not be feasible to exhaustively remove all references
to Gold in the Celo codebase. This is deemed as acceptable given that this
complexity is levied on developers who are familiar with the ecosystem and not
the general public.

### Usage guidelines

- While the name Celo should be capitalized as a proper noun when used outside
  of code/tooling, it's acceptable to use a lowercase "native asset" in the
  long-form name.
- Alternative long-form names such as "Celo reserve token" or "Celo staking
  asset" should be avoided.
- The shortened form should be referred to as Celo in both singular and plural
  form, e.g., "what's the price of Celo?" "I'm staking some Celo on your group."
- The recommended abbreviation and ticker symbol for Celo will be CELO.

## Verification

This proposal itself involves no code changes or verification.

## Risks

- There is a risk of confusion between the shortened form referring to both the
  ecosystem and the native asset. In contexts where the distinction is
  insufficiently clear the long-form name should be used.
- Some refactoring may be too difficult, especially attempting to rename the
  `LockedGold` and `ReleaseGold` smart contracts. These will likely remain
  referred to as gold within the codebase.
- The name change will introduce some thrash and require renaming on exchanges
  but the earlier this is proposed the fewer exchanges that will need to be
  updated.
