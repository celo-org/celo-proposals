## Overview

This change increases the TargetVotingGoldFraction from 50% to 60% by setting `TargetVotingGoldFraction` to 600000000000000000000000. 
The actual voting gold fraction is currently ~60%. Increasing the target to 60% would help ensure that users continue to stake in the face of a growing Celo defi ecosystem.

Parameter Details:

- targetVotingGoldFraction: 500000000000000000000000 (0.5 * 10^24) --> 600000000000000000000000 (0.6 * 10^24)


## Proposed Changes

1. Set EpochRewards targetVotingGoldFraction
  - Destination: EpochRewards, [setTargetVotingGoldFraction](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L135)
  - Data: 
    - _targetVotingGoldFraction = 600000000000000000000000 
  - Value: 0 (NA)


## Verification

Check that`targetVotingGoldFraction` through [getTargetVotingGoldFraction] is actually changed to 600000000000000000000000
