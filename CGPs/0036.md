## Overview

This change increases the Validator Target Payments from yearly 75000 cUSD to 85000 cUSD by setting the parameter `targetValidatorEpochPayment` from 205479452054794520547 to 232876712328767123287. Validator Rewards are subject to adjustments for target schedule, which means that the target rewards are currently being scaled down to ~87%, resulting in currently only ~65000 cUSD being paid out to validators annualized. This change tries to mitigate that downscaling and to keep the expected Validator Payments more constant. 

To ensure that Celo continues to be a desirable network on which to validate, the increase to 85000 cUSD per year roughly restores the original 75000 cUSD validator rewards per year. The Validator Rewards share of overall Epoch Rewards is currently around 10%, after the proposed change at ~12.5%, so the increase here is small and does not contribute significantly to the rewarding ahead of target schedule.

Parameter Details:

- targetValidatorEpochPayment: 205479452054794520547 --> 232876712328767123287  (85000 / 365 * 10^18)

## Proposed Changes

1. Set Epoch Rewards Target Validator Epoch Payment
  - Destination: EpochRewards, [setTargetValidatorEpochPayment](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/governance/EpochRewards.sol#L249)
  - Data: 
    - _targetValidatorEpochPayment = 232876712328767123287 (85000 / 365 * 10^18)
  - Value: 0 (NA)


## Verification

Check the Epoch Rewards Proxy contract parameter if the `targetValidatorEpochPayment`, item 33, is actually changed to the proposed value.

## Risks
- Smart Contract / Deployment risk: To propose and execute a larger or smaller parameter by accident, e.g. one decimal too few or too much.
- This parameter change would contribute a bit to the rewarding ahead of target schedule, but since the validator share of epoch rewards is only roughly 10%, this contribution would be minimal.
