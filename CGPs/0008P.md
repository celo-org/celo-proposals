## Overview

Increasing the exchange parameter `reserveFraction` to 0.5% (from 0.1%): This change increases the on-chain cUSD/CELO liquidity by increasing the bucket-sizes in the Uniswap-style exchange mechanism.

In governance proposal [CGP0007](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CGPs/0007.md) that activated the Celo stability protocol, the `reserveFraction` parameter was set to a level of 0.1% to “ [...] limit the risk for the Celo reserve right after stability protocol activation, which is a period during which users are still setting up bots interacting with the stability mechanism and CELO/USD market liquidity is evolving.”

Since stability protocol activation, the oracle setup performed reliably, bots interacting with the stability mechanism got deployed and market liquidity has not changed significantly. On the basis of these developments, it is proposed to increase the `reserveFraction` parameter to 0.5%. Given the protocol state (CELO/USD median rate, unfrozen reserve CELO amount, etc.) at the time of creation of this proposal, this would reduce the slippage for instant sales of 1,000 Celo Dollars (cUSD) from about 3.75% to about 0.75%. The increased `reserveFraction` parameter would also increase the expansion and contraction potential of the stability mechanism and therefore speed-up adjustments of the cUSD supply after cUSD demand shocks.

An increase beyond 0.5% is currently not advisable as CELO/USD market liquidity is still low: Judging from current order books at centralized exchanges, buy orders of 10k CELO have an estimated market price impact of about 5%. To mitigate the risk of an off-chain price manipulation attack, the on-chain price reaction to large trades should be bigger than the off-chain price reaction to a market order of a similar size. This is the case with a 0.5% `reserveFraction` as a 10k CELO buy order would roughly lead to a 15% on-chain price movement which gives additional slack in case of changes of off-chain or on-chain liquidity related quantities. For more background on off-chain price manipulation attacks, please take a look at [Increasing Robustness of the Terra Oracle](https://agora.terra.money/uploads/short-url/i0qz8LDesetkgfBBFWas1HORDYb.pdf). 

Market liquidity is related to demand for Celo currencies. If this demand increases, for example in response to pilot projects carried out by members of the Alliance for Prosperity, further increases of  `reserveFraction` may become advisable. 


## Proposed Changes

1. Set Reserve Fraction to 0.5%
  - Destination: Exchange, [setReserveFraction](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/stability/Exchange.sol#L240)
  - Data: 5000000000000000000000 (5/1000 * 10^24 = 1e21) 
  - Value: 0 (NA)

## Verification

1. Confirm proposal steps: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID X` // TODO add proposal ID once submitted proposal
2. Confirm Exchange and StableToken addresses: run `celocli network:contracts`


## Risks

- Oracle rate risk: In case of imprecise CELO/USD oracle rates and/or manipulated CELO/USD market rates, users could exchange cUSD or CELO with the reserve at a price that does not reflect the current market valuation. The increased `reserveFraction` parameter would lead to a larger loss of the reserve in such a case.
