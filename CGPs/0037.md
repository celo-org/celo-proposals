# CGP [0037]: Celo Core Contracts Release 5

- Date: 2021-08-12
- Author(s): @m-chrzan
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: TBD
- Date Executed: TBD
- Discussions To: TBD

## Overview

In this governance proposal, we propose to execute the Celo Core Contracts Upgrade Release 5. This release follows the [release process](https://docs.celo.org/community/release-process/smart-contracts).

Changes that are being proposed in this release are described in [this Github release](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/releases/tag/core-contracts.v5.pre-audit).
OpenZeppelin has completed an audit of release 5, and the tooling provided ensures the version control references included in the report match the contract deployment described in the proposal contents.

## Proposed Changes

Please see the release notes for more details on the changes itself. The actual on-chain effects are as follows:

Core Contracts (via `setImplementation`)
- `GrandaMento`: new contract, version `1.1.0.0`
- `StableToken`: `1.2.0.0` => `1.2.0.1`
- `StableTokenEUR`: `1.1.0.0` => `1.1.0.1`
- `Validators`: `1.2.0.0` => `1.2.0.1`

## Verification

Fetch onchain proposal:
```
celocli governance:show --proposalID <TBD> --jsonTransactions release-5-proposal.json --node https://forno.celo.org
```

Verify proposal points to deployment which matches audited release:
```
cd monorepo/packages/protocol
yarn verify-release -p release-5-proposal.json -b core-contracts.v5 -n mainnet -f
```

## Risks

Celo Core Contracts are critical for the functioning of the Celo Platform. This proposal touches contracts which impact Celo's Proof-of-Stake and consensus and the stability protocol.
While cLabs have invested significant efforts to expand testing and verification tooling, and a third party audit has been completed, errors in this proposal could lead to situations that are only recoverable with a very difficult hard fork.
