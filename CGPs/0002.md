- Date: 2020-05-12
- Author(s): @aslawson
- Status: DRAFT
- Governance Proposal ID #: [if submitted]
- Date Executed: [if executed]

## Overview

This change unfreezes Celo Gold transfers by removing the GoldToken smart contract from the Freezer contract's `isFrozen` map.

## Proposed Changes

1. Remove GoldToken smart contract from the Freezer
  - Destination: Freezer, [unfreeze](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/common/Freezer.sol#L27)
  - Data: 0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438 (GoldToken Address)
  - Value: 0 (NA)

## Verification
1. Confirm proposal steps: run `celocli governance:view --proposalID x` // TODO add proposal ID once submitted proposal
2. Confirm GoldToken address: run `celocli network:contracts`

### Post-Execution Verification
1. Check that a (non-whitelisted) account can transfer celo gold to another (non-whitelisted) account.  You can do so by running CeloCli tooling for [transfer:gold](https://docs.celo.org/command-line-interface/transfer#gold)
2. Check Freezer [isFrozen map](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/de09a44f5ea2c2116506a6b3d05dcaaef92d4fad/packages/protocol/contracts/common/Freezer.sol#L9) no longer contains the GoldToken Address.

## Risks

Low risk, if unsuccessful there is no change to the network.
