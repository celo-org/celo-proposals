# Abstract
A Celo Improvement Proposal (CIP) describe standards for the Celo platform, including the core protocol specifications, SDK, and contract standards. It is a design document providing information to the Celo community, or describing a new feature for Celo or its processes or environment, a rationale for the proposal, detailed solution including technical specifications, and, if any, a list of potential risks. 

The CIP proposer, the **author** is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting whether there is rough consensus on their proposal. 

Because the CIPs are maintained as text files in a versioned repository, their revision history is the historical record of the feature proposal.

Participation in the Celo project and the CIP process is informed by the Celo [Community Tenets](https://celo.org/community) and subject to the  [Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).

# CIP Types
There are three types of CIP:

* A **Standards Track CIP** describes any change that affects most or all Celo implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using Celo. Furthermore Standard CIPs can be broken down into the following categories. Standards Track CIPs consist of two parts, a design document and implementation.
	* **Core** - improvements requiring a consensus fork, as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to  “core dev” discussions, and the validator/node strategy.
	* **Governance** - improvements to the governance proposal to the Celo platform including parameter changes. It should explain the reason for the change, enumerate the smart contract methods that will be called with parameters, and describe the impact and any risks. 
	* **Networking** - improvements to networking protocol specifications such as devp2p, and proposed improvements like whisper and swarm.
	* **Interface** - improvements around client [API/RPC] specifications and standards, and also certain language-level standards like method names and contract ABIs.
	* **CRC** - (Celo [Request for Comments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)) application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, name registries, URI schemes, library/package formats, and wallet formats.
* A **Meta CIP** describes a process surrounding Celo or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process CIPs are like Standards Track CIPs but apply to areas other than the Celo protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to Celo’s codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational CIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include code of conduct updates, procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in Celo development. Any Meta CIP is also considered a Process CIP.
* An **Informational CIP** describes a Celo design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the Celo community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational CIPs do not necessarily represent Celo community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational CIPs or follow their advice.

It is highly recommended that a single CIP contain a single key proposal or new idea.

A CIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement as to be determined by the CIP editors during the PR review process. For more information on the CIP Editor role, see the appropriate section below.


# CIP Workflow
## Shepherding a CIP
Parties involved in the process are you, the champion or _CIP author_, the CIP editors, and the Celo Core Developers (core developers are the developers working on the Celo client).

Before you begin writing a formal CIP, you should vet your idea. Ask the Celo community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be be rejected based on prior research. It is thus recommended to open a discussion thread on Issues section of the CIP process to do this, but you can also use the Celo Discord and the [Celo Forum](https://forum.celo.org) and engage with the community about your idea.

In addition to making sure your idea is original, it will be your role as the author to make your idea clear to reviewers and interested parties, as well as inviting editors, developers and community to give feedback on the aforementioned channels. You should try and gauge whether the interest in your CIP is commensurate with both the work involved in implementing it and how many parties will have to conform to it. For example, the work required to implement a Core CIP will be much greater than for a CRC and the CIP will need to be reviewed carefully by the Celo community. Negative community feedback will be taken into consideration and may prevent your CIP from moving past the Draft stage.

Building consensus with the Celo community must adhere to the [Celo Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct). Further, your proposal is much more likely to build consensus if you it aligns with the [Celo Community Tenets](https://celo.org/community) and furthers the Celo project's mission.

## Core CIPs
For Core CIPs, given that they require Celo’s client implementation to be considered **Final** (see “CIPs Process” below), the blockchain author will need to either provide an implementation for the celo-blockchain client or convince clients to implement your CIP.

The best way to get client implementers to review your CIP is to present it on a Celo AllCoreDevs call. You can request to do so by posting a comment linking your CIP on an agenda issue for an upcoming call on the Github repository.

The Celo AllCoreDevs call serve as a way for client implementers and stakeholders to do two things. First, to discuss the technical merits of CIPs. Second, to coordinate CIP implementation for network upgrades. 

These calls generally result in a “[rough consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rough_consensus)” around what CIPs should be implemented. Rough consensus, first used by IETF to describe how working groups would proceed, rests on the assumptions that CIPs are not contentious enough to cause a network split and that they are technically sound. It also states that 51% of working group voting on a specific action isn't rough consensus, while 99% is better than rough consensus.

⚠️ The CIPs process and AllCoreDevs call were not designed to address contentious non-technical issues, but, due to the lack of other ways to address these, often end up entangled in them. This puts the burden on core developers to try and gauge community sentiment, which hinders the technical coordination function of CIPs and AllCoreDevs calls. If you are shepherding a CIP, you can make the process of building community consensus easier by making sure that the Github issue thread for your CIP includes or links to as much of the community discussion as possible and that various stakeholders are well-represented.

_In short, your role as the champion is to write the CIP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea._

## CIP Process
When we talk about the community from the perspective of the CIP Process, we are talking about all the validators, stakeholders, core-developers, dapp developers, volunteers and active participants involved in the CIP Process.

Rough Consensus, as mentioned in the previous section, is used to measure community sentiment about a particular proposal. Rough Consensus is measured mostly on the All-Core Devs calls, but it can also happen outside of those calls on Github or Celo Forum comments. Rough Consensus will be determined by the Hardfork Coordinator and All-Core Dev Call organizer based on feedback of the network participants during the call. 


Following is the process that a successful non-Core CIP will move along:
```
[ WIP ] -> [ DRAFT ] -> [ LAST CALL ] -> [ FINAL ]
```

Following is the process that a successful Core CIP will move along:
```
[ IDEA ] -> [ DRAFT ] -> [ LAST CALL ] -> [ ACCEPTED ] -> [ FINAL ]
```
Each status change is requested by the CIP author and reviewed by the CIP editors who are specified in the section below. Use a pull request to update the status. Please include a link to where people should continue discussing your CIP such as a Github Issue or a post on the Celo Forum. The CIP editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.
* **Idea** — Once the champion has asked the Celo community whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft CIP as a  [pull request](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/pulls). Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in studying the CIP.
	* ➡️ Draft — If agreeable, CIP editor will assign the CIP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the CIP) and merge your pull request. The CIP editor will not unreasonably deny a CIP.
	* ❌ Draft — Reasons for denying Draft status include being too unfocused, too broad, duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the  Celo values and code of conduct.
* **Draft** — Once the first draft has been merged, you may submit follow-up pull requests with further changes to your draft until such point as you believe the CIP to be mature and ready to proceed to the next status. A CIP in draft status must be implemented to be considered for promotion to the next status (ignore this requirement for core CIPs).
	* ➡️ Last Call — If agreeable, the CIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date (review-period-end), normally 14 days later.
	* ❌ Last Call — A request for Last Call status will be denied if material changes are still expected to be made to the draft. We hope that CIPs only enter Last Call once, so as to avoid unnecessary noise on the RSS feed.
* **Last Call** — This CIP will listed prominently on the  [https://cips.celo.org/](https://cips.celo.org/) website. **NOTE: CIP website is not live yet**
	* ❌ — A Last Call which results in material changes or substantial unaddressed technical complaints will cause the CIP to revert to Draft.
	* ➡️ Accepted (Core CIPs only) — A successful Last Call without material changes or unaddressed technical complaints will become Accepted.
	* ✅ Final (Non-Core CIPs) — A successful Last Call without material changes or unaddressed technical complaints will become Final.
* **Accepted (Core CIPs only)** — This status signals that material changes are unlikely and Celo client developers should consider this CIP for inclusion. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the CIP process.
	* ⬅️ Draft — The Core Devs can decide to move this CIP back to the Draft status at their discretion. E.g. a major, but correctable, flaw was found in the CIP.
	* ❌ Rejected — The Core Devs can decide to mark this CIP as Rejected at their discretion. E.g. a major, but uncorrectable, flaw was found in the CIP.
	* ✅ Final — Standards Track Core CIPs must be implemented in the Celo client before it can be considered Final. When the implementation is complete and adopted by the community, the status will be changed to “Final”.
* **Final** — This CIP represents the current state-of-the-art. A Final CIP should only be updated to correct errata.

Other exceptional statuses include:
* **Active** — Some Informational and Process CIPs may also have a status of “Active” if they are never meant to be completed. E.g. CIP 1000 (this CIP).
* **Abandoned** — This CIP is no longer pursued by the original authors or it may not be a (technically) preferred option anymore.
	* ➡️ Draft — Authors or new champions wishing to pursue this CIP can ask for changing it to Draft status.
* **Rejected** — A CIP that is fundamentally broken or a Core CIP that was rejected by the Core Devs and will not be implemented. A CIP cannot move on from this state.
* **Superseded** — A CIP which was previously Final but is no longer considered state-of-the-art. Another CIP will be in Final status and reference the Superseded CIP. A CIP cannot move on from this state.

## What belongs in a successful CIP?
Each CIP should have the following parts:
* **Preamble** - [RFC 822 style headers](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/) containing metadata about the CIP, including the CIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), and the author details. See below for details.
* **Abstract** - A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
* **Motivation** (*optional) - The motivation is critical for CIPs that want to change the Celo protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the CIP solves. CIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
* **Specification** - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow implementation in the celo-blockchain client.
* **Rationale** - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
* **Backwards Compatibility** - All CIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The CIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. CIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.
* **Test Cases** - Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for CIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other CIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.
* **Implementations** - The implementations must be completed before any CIP is given status “Final”, but it need not be completed before the CIP is merged as draft. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of “rough consensus and running code” is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
* **Security Considerations** - All CIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. CIP submissions missing the “Security Considerations” section will be rejected. A CIP cannot proceed to status “Final” without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
* **Copyright Waiver** - All CIPs must be in the public domain. See the bottom of this CIP for an example copyright waiver.
## CIP Formats and Templates
CIPs should be written in  [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)  format. There is a  [template](https://github.com/celo-org/celo-proposals/blob/master/CIPs/template.md)  to follow.

## CIP Header Preamble
Each CIP must begin with an  [RFC 822](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc822.txt)  style header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (—). This header is also termed  [“front matter” by Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) . The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with “*” are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.
`cip`: _CIP number_ (this is determined by the CIP editor)
`title`: _CIP title_
`author`: _a list of the author’s or authors’ name(s) and_or username(s), or name(s) and email(s). Details are below./
`* discussions-to`: _a url pointing to the official discussion thread_
status: _Draft, Last Call, Accepted, Final, Active, Abandoned, Rejected, or Superseded_
`* review-period-end`: _date review period ends_
type: _Standards Track, Meta, or Informational_
`* category`: _Core, Governance, Networking, Interface, or CRC_ (fill out for Standards Track CIPs only)
`created`: _date created on_
`* updated`: _comma separated list of dates_
`* requires`: _CIP number(s)_
`* replaces`: _CIP number(s)_
`* superseded-by`: _CIP number(s)_
`* resolution`: _a url pointing to the resolution of this CIP_
Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.
Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).
### `author` header
The author header optionally lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the CIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the author header value must be:
> Random J. User <   [address@dom.ain](mailto:address@dom.ain) >  
or
> Random J. User (@username)  
if the email address or GitHub username is included, and
> Random J. User  
if the email address is not given.
### `resolution` header
The resolution header is required for Standards Track CIPs only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web resource where the pronouncement about the CIP is made.
### `discussions-to` header
While a CIP is a draft, a discussions-to header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the CIP is being discussed. As mentioned above, examples for places to discuss your CIP include the Celo Discord , an issue in this repo or in a fork of this repo.
No discussions-to header is necessary if the CIP is being discussed privately with the author.
As a single exception, discussions-to cannot point to GitHub pull requests.
### `type` header
The type header specifies the type of CIP: Standards Track, Meta, or Informational. If the track is Standards please include the subcategory (core, networking, interface, or CRC).
### `category` header
The category header specifies the CIP’s category. This is required for standards-track CIPs only.
### `created` header
The created header records the date that the CIP was assigned a number. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.
### `updated` header
The updated header records the date(s) when the CIP was updated with “substantial” changes. This header is only valid for CIPs of Draft and Active status.
### `requires` header
CIPs may have a requires header, indicating the CIP numbers that this CIP depends on.
### `superseded-by` and `replaces` headers
CIPs may also have a superseded-by header indicating that a CIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the CIP that replaces the current document. The newer CIP must have a replaces header containing the number of the CIP that it rendered obsolete.

## Auxiliary Files
Images, diagrams and auxiliary files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that CIP as follows: `assets/cip-N` (where **N** is to be replaced with the CIP number). When linking to an image in the CIP, use relative links such as `../assets/cip-1/image.png`.


# Transferring CIP Ownership
It occasionally becomes necessary to transfer ownership of CIPs to a new champion. In general, we’d like to retain the original author as a co-author of the transferred CIP, but that’s really up to the original author. A good reason to transfer ownership is because the original author no longer has the time or interest in updating it or following through with the CIP process, or has fallen off the face of the ‘net (i.e. is unreachable or isn’t responding to email). A bad reason to transfer ownership is because you don’t agree with the direction of the CIP. We try to build consensus around a CIP, but if that’s not possible, you can always submit a competing CIP.
If you are interested in assuming ownership of a CIP, send a message asking to take over, addressed to both the original author and the CIP editor. If the original author doesn’t respond to email in a timely manner, the CIP editor will make a unilateral decision.

# CIP Editors
The current CIP editors are:
`* James Prestwich (@prestwich)`
`* Yaz Khoury (@YazzyYaz)`

# CIP Editor Responsibilities
For each new CIP that comes in, an editor does the following:
* Read the CIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.
* The title should accurately describe the content.
* Ensure that the CIP is in line with Celo's [vision and values](https://celo.org/about), and that discussion around it conforms to the [Celo Code of Conduct](https://celo.org/code-of-conduct).
* Check the CIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup (GitHub flavored Markdown), code style

If the CIP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision, with specific instructions.
Once the CIP is ready for the repository, the CIP editor will:
* Assign a CIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this CIP)
* Merge the corresponding pull request
* Send a message back to the CIP author with the next step.

Many CIPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the Celo codebase. The CIP editors monitor CIP changes, and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes we see.

The editors don’t pass judgment on CIPs. We merely do the administrative & editorial part.

# Style Guide
When referring to a CIP by number, it should be written in the hyphenated form CIP-X where X is the CIP’s assigned number.

# History
This document was derived heavily from [EIP-1](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1.md) written by Hudson Jameson and Martin Becze which in turn was derived from [Bitcoin’s BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from  [Python’s PEP-0001](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) . In many places text was simply copied and modified. Although the PEP-0001 text was written by Barry Warsaw, Jeremy Hylton, and David Goodger, they are not responsible for its use in the Celo Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Celo or the CIP. Please direct all comments to the CIP editors.
